## GigaBee_XC6LX-AXI 
**ï»¿Recommended starting point for EDK-based designs**  

Hardware: Trenz Electronic TE0600 (GigaBee) XC6SLX100

Development environment: Xilinx ISE XMP v13.2

This HW project is derived from SP605_AXI (Gigabit Ethernet, DMA, 100 MHz Microblaze) of Xilinx XAPP1026 "LightWeight IP (lwIP) Application Examples"

www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/application_notes/xapp1026.pdf

Software from XAPP1026 is fully compatible with this HW design.

Remarks:

+ PARAMETER C_USE_BRANCH_TARGET_CACHE was set to 0 to meet timing requirements.
+ When upgrading to ISE XMP v13.3 or higher, we reccommend NOT to upgrade the AXI_ETHERNET core to v3.00.a, as we could not get it work!
+ Re-implement to specific FPGA device (LX45, LX150) by

1. setting the proper FPGA device in project options and
2. uncommenting the corresponding IDELAY_VALUE at the beginning of data/system.ucf file!



## GigaBee_XC6LX-Blinkin 
* hardware: Trenz Electronic GigaBee XC6SLX
* reference design: Clock and LED VHDL usage example
    good starting point for bistream generation options testing and SPI flash 
	booting sucesfully tested with x4 SPI mode, 80MHz SPI clock and compression 
	enabled
* development environment: Xilinx ISE PN v13.2


## GigaBee_UDP_Datalogger
* hardware: Trenz Electronic GigaBee XC6SLX45
* development environment: Xilinx ISE XMP v13.1
This project demonstrates how to use GigaBee board
together with baseboard equipped by ethernet connector as
a data logger with 16 digital inputs and output in form
of broadcast UDP ethernet packets transmitted to Gigabit
Ethernet network (Gigabit only. Doesn't work for 100Mbps.).


## GigaBee_XC6SLX-MIG
* hardware: Trenz Electronic GigaBee XC6SLX
* reference design: Modified Memory Interface Generator 3.61 project to fit 
	GigaBee
* development environment: Xilinx ISE PN v12.4

**Projects under active development - not recomended for new users**


## GigaBee_XC6LX-AXI_lite 

* hardware: Trenz Electronic GigaBee XC6SLX100
* reference design: Xilinx XAPP1026, derived from sp601_Axi 
	(10/100 EthernetLite), Microblaze clock 100MHz
	Software from XAPP1026 is fully compatible with this HW design
* read documentation at 
	http://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/application_notes/xapp1026.pdf
* development environment: Xilinx ISE XMP v13.1
* Does not work!!!Problems with software 
	(we suspect Ethernet PHY address is wrong)!!
